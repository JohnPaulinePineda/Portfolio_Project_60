This [project](https://johnpaulinepineda.github.io/Portfolio_Project_60/) explores open-source solutions for containerizing and deploying machine learning API endpoints, focusing on the implementation of a heart failure survival prediction model as a web application. The objective was to operationalize a Cox Proportional Hazards Regression survival model by deploying an interactive UI that enables users to input cardiovascular, hematologic, and metabolic markers and receive survival probability estimates at different time points. The project workflow involved multiple stages: first, a RESTful API was developed using the FastAPI framework to serve the survival prediction model. The API was tested locally to ensure correct response formatting and model inference behavior. Next, the application was containerized using Docker, enabling a reproducible and portable environment. The Docker image was built, tested, and pushed to DockerHub for persistent storage before being deployed on Render, an open-source cloud platform for hosting containerized applications. To enable user interaction, a web-based interface was developed using Streamlit. The UI facilitated data input via range sliders and radio buttons, processed user entries, and sent requests to the FastAPI backend for prediction and visualization. The Streamlit app was then deployed on Render to ensure full integration with the containerized API. End-to-end testing verified the functionality of the deployed application, confirming that API endpoints, model predictions, and UI elements worked seamlessly together.
